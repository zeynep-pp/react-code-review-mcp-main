**📘 Day 2: How Agents Actually Work: Tool Use, Autonomy & Frameworks**

Now that you’ve setup your developer enviornment, it’s time to dive deeper into what actually makes something an **agent.**

### We’ll cover:

- **What _is_ an Agent, Really?**
  → Cover main design patterns and levels of autonomy.
  → Difference between workflows and agents
- **How Tool Calling Works**
  → The core mechanism behind agent behavior: calling functions, APIs, and tools based on natural language goals.
- **Recommended Agentic Frameworks** (Keep it simple, stay focused)

  → _Python:_ OpenAI Agents SDK

  → _Next.js:_ OpenAI Agents SDK

- 🧑‍💻 Live Coding streams

  Instructor will build na agent using AI SDK and show an example with Typescript and Python

- 📄 End-of-week assignment
  - Ship a very small agent in your preferred tech stack

**Live Support & Unblocking**

Every Friday, we host a live Q&A session to help you get unstuck and finish your weekly assignments with confidence.

Bring your questions, blockers, and half-working code, we’ll walk through it together so you can:

- Get the help you need in real time
- Learn from other students’ challenges
- Stay on track to submit your homework before the start of the next week
- Share new frameworks, tools you found for your own projects!

This is your space to ask _anything_ — technical, strategic, or career-related. Let’s keep the momentum going.

**📘 Lesson 3**

**Expanding Your Agent’s Toolkit with APIs, MCP, Web Search, and more…**

Now that you’ve built your first agent, it’s time to go beyond basic tools use and give your agent access to the **real world.**

Today, we explore how agents can interact with 3rd party APIs, search engines, and even other outside systems.

### We’ll cover:

- How to use 3rd party APIs as tools?
- What is MCP and How to Use It?
- Web Search & Web Crawl with Agents

- **🧑‍💻 Live Coding streams:**
  We’ll build an agent that:
  - Connects to an **MCP server**
  - Uses **web search + RAG** as tools
  - Demonstrates how agents can handle dynamic, real-world queries
    (A specific use case will guide this build.)
- 📄 End-of-week assignment
  **Ship a new agent** that does one of the following:
  - Connects to MCP
  - Performs live web search
  - Uses 3rd party APIs
    Pick one. Make it work.

📚 **RAG Fundamentals:**

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Agentic AI**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is at the core of most production AI systems today but most people are still building it wrong.

In this session, we’ll break down what RAG really is, how it works, and why it’s more than just plugging in a vector database.

### You’ll learn:

- **What is RAG?**
  → How retrieval and generation work together to ground LLMs in real data
  → Why RAG is ultimately a _search_ problem, not just a _vector search_ problem
- **Vector Search 101**
  → When and why to use vector search
  → Intro to common tools:
  • **Vectorize** for lightweight local RAG
  • **Pinecone** for scalable vector databases
- **Recommended RAG Platforms**
  → What to use based on your stack (Next.js vs Python)
  → How to evaluate RAG quality and avoid common pitfalls

**📣 Monday Demo Day: Show What You Built**

After a weekend of building, it’s time to ship.

Every Monday, you’ll present your project in front of your cohort, no matter how polished or messy. This isn’t about perfection. It’s about momentum, iteration, and building in public.

Use Demo Day to:

- Get real feedback from instructors and peers
- Learn by watching how others approached the same challenge
- Build your confidence sharing technical work out loud

**Remember:** Done is better than perfect. Ship it, show it, and improve next week.

Only best projects will have a chance to present on Mondays!
So do your best to impress.
